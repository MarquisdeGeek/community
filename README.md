# Community : Codes of operation

What exists here is an idea to provide transparency between the organizers of community events (like meetups, hackathons, conferences, etc) and those who wish to attend.

* Too often I see speakers being asked to pay for their own transport and accomodation... for events that the organizers are charging Â£200 per ticket!

* Too often I see hackathons asking developers to work on a company's new API... and being charged entry for the privilege.

* Too often I see good papers being rejected... only to be recycled by a friend or associate of the organizer(s).

* Too often I see successful and prominent speakers being 'invited' to appear... only to be asked later to pay for the honour.

I have personally experienced all these. And worse.

Now, I accept the world isn't fair. And rejection is a fact of life. But as a community we can at least be open as to the reasons. Because let's face it, in today's social and connected world we're all sharing this information between ourselves, anyway!
