# An organizers guide to the "Code of Operations"

Organizers should git clone the "Code of operations" file, remove the lines which do not apply, and add specifics to the lines where necessary (to include mentors and finance figures.) To aid you in what the community expects, we have added the following notes.

## Notes

A. The announcement
 1. If there is no theme, then say "Open". 
 2. Give as much detail of the individuals. Meeting a developer idol, VC, or entrepeneur can increase visibility and attendance. Mention any and all industry experts or employees attending.
 3. The key phrase is 'specific prizes' as "some great prizes" is not suitable! Attendees need to know whether it's worth their time. Prizes need not be monetary, it could be access to services, hardware, or people (mentors, investors, industry experts, organizer's employees.)

B. Demographic
  1. How many people are you inviting? Do you have a maximum limit, imposed by health and safety? A rough guide is a better number than omitting the line.
  2. Detail the company, and the position, if you don't have names
  3. It's generally accepted that the hosting company will want to recruit the best talent, but if other recruiters are likely to be there it should be clear.
  
C. Attendees expect
  1. Being asked to sign over work you're doing, even for free, isn't legally binding without a contract.
  2. There should be at least one technical person (either developer or develop relations) per API/service in use.
  3. Attendees should not be expected to pay to access the tools or services they need. If they are required to provide an email address to sign up for a sponsors API, they should expect to NOT be spammed as a consequence.
  4. Hackathons are meant to be fun, paperwork is the antithesis of this! If you need NDAs, maybe a hackathon is not the appropriate vehicle

D. Organizers will (for you...)
  1. If you don't have code of conduct, please consider using http://confcodeofconduct.com/
  2. There will often be shy individuals in the developer community. Having other teams on stage, proactively asking for help, is a boon.
  3. Post the hashtag in the building and tweet regularly. Retweet attendees progress regularly.  
  4. Building code off-site isn't in the spirit, nor fair on newcomers. If pre-built code wins too much/too often it could be your last hackathon!
  5. Post the network address and password around the building. Organizers should hire someone to install and maintain this, and not rely on the (already busy) attendees.

E. Organizers will (for us...)
  1. Be honest about your intentions. Developers hold the technical keys to every company's infrastructure, don't treat them like replaceable unit!
  
F. Organizers provide
  1. Exact menus aren't necessary or helpful, but a guide as to whether dinner means "a baguette" or "full cooked meal in the company canteen" is helpful
  2. Indicate if the only snacks available are from a (paid for) vending machine. If no snacks are available, mention the closest (open) supermarket during the introduction session. (If held at a weekend, check the local opening times.)
  3. This greases the wheels for a lot of potential attendees!

G. Money
  1. If you're only providing the venue, and security, then say so
  2. An indication of the amount is not necessary, but if they're paying for items (e.g. dinner, the beers) then indicate this
  3. If the attendees are paying anything, then explain why. They're doing work for free, after all.

H. Post-event
  1. A few tweets, or contact emails, after the event can keep your event in the developers mind.
