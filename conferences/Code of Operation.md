# Conference Organizers : Code of Operation

A conference should enable the industry to come together to learn from talks, see new products, network, and encourage growth at both a business and personal level. It shouldn't be a series of glorified sales pitches! Therefore, we, the conference organizers use this document to indicate our objectives clearly and transparently to the community. (We have deleted parts from the original document where not applicable.)

## Operations

A. In our call for papers (CFP), or on any invites we make, we shall make clear on our first approach:
  1. the subject and scope for submissions
  2. that a full conference ticket is included, along with any additional sessions
  3. if we pay hotel costs, and for how many nights
  4. if we pay travel costs, and to what amount
  5. if we pay a speaking fee for the talk
  6. the category of talk (e.g. keynote, general, lightning) and its expected duration
  
B. All the talks on our schedule:
  1. are fully confirmed and will be honoured, to the best of our ability
  2. will indicate the speakers employers and affiliations
  3. will indicate whether they are sponsored (i.e. the speakers or their employer/agent is paying for the slot)
  4. will provide an opportunity for Q&A (either at the end, or shortly afterwards)

C. For any speaking slots awarded from an open CFP.
  1. we will indicate the judging and qualifying criteria
  2. we will publish the titles of unsuccessful talks
  3. we will indicate the ratio of international and local (e.g. 2 hours travel) speakers

D. During the conference we shall ensure a safe and threat-free environment, following our code of conduct.
