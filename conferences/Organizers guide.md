# An organizers guide to the "Code of Operation"

Organizers should git clone the "Code of operations" file, remove the lines which do not apply, and add specifics to the lines where necessary (to include mentors and finance figures.) To aid you in what the community expects, we have added the following notes.

## Notes

A. Call for papers
 1. Scope should include the date and location of the talk. If the conference extends multiple days, then list all, unless you can be sure of allocated space on a specific day.
 2. You'd need a pretty good reason to _not_ provide this! Indicate what is included for a paying conference-goers ticket.
 3. If the conference is held in a hotel, it's assumed this is the hotel involved. If not, the hotel should be specified.
 4. If the speaker wishes to travel first class, and it's still in budget, it's expected that this will be acceptable unless previously stated.
 5. Payment of taxes on this fee is the speakers responsibility.
 6. Examples of previous conferences is helpful, but not expected.

B. All talks
 1. Confirm with the speaker as early as possible
 2. Include the employer only if requested by the speaker
 3. This should be made clear on the web site and programme
 4. If appropriate for the talk, venue, and audience size

C. Slots from open CFP
 1. Jugding criteria should be stated in advance
 2. If the speakers allow it, include their names and abstracts, too.
 3. Show for both failed submissions, and successful speakers. This will also help attract internaional talent at future events.
 4. If possible indicate a line in the CFP saying "all successful speakers will be contacted by DATE". If not possible (because of overwhelming demand, etc) then give relative time lines.

D. If you don't have code of conduct, please consider using http://confcodeofconduct.com/
